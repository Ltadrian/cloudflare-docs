The `/content` endpoint instructs the browser to navigate to a website and capture the fully rendered HTML of a page, including the `head` section, after JavaScript execution. This is ideal for capturing content from JavaScript-heavy or interactive websites.

## Basic usage

Go to `https://example.com` and return the rendered HTML.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<accountId>/browser-rendering/content' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <apiToken>' \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
```

## Advanced usage

Navigate to `https://cloudflare.com/` but block images and stylesheets from loading. Undesired requests can be blocked by resource type (`rejectResourceTypes`) or by using a regex pattern (`rejectRequestPattern`).

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<accountId>/browser-rendering/content' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <apiToken>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "url": "https://cloudflare.com/",
  "rejectResourceTypes": ["image"],
  "rejectRequestPattern": ["/^.*\\.(css)"]
}

```

### Parameters

- `url` _(string)_ - The URL of the webpage to extract content from.
- `rejectResourceTypes` _(array)_ - Blocks specific resource types such as images, fonts from loading to improve performance.
- `rejectRequestPattern` _(array of regex patterns)_ - Prevents loading of resources matching specified patterns such as CSS files.
